Summary:
--------

Given:  You are given a Python Class template. In this template there
        is one class, MyHeap. The goal of this lab is to implement 
        a max heap.

Task:   - First, create a method called getName() that returns your 
        name. If this does not work, you will receive a mark of zero.  
        
        - A class called MyHeap is given. Implement the follow methods: 
        __init__(self, array) create; insers the initial array and build the
        heap using the O(n) methodt(self, data) should insert a
        new element in the heap;  heapify(self) should ensure that the 
        heap property is maintained after insertion; extractFirst() 
        should return the first element of the heap; __len__() should 
        return the size of the heap in O(1); getData(self) should 
        return the array.

        - You should use a single list to fill data. 
        
Rule:   You may not use heapq to implement this.
